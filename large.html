   <u> <h1>Top Modern Large Mammalian - </h1></u>


<h2>* While many large mammals are herbivores (like elephants and rhinos), several key species dominate as predators: </h2>

<b><h4><u>Polar Bear:</u> The largest living land carnivoran, with males reaching up to 1,000 kg (2,209 lbs). They primarily hunt seals on Arctic sea ice.<br><br>

<u>Killer Whale (Orca):</u> Technically the largest species of dolphin, weighing up to 10 tonnes. They are the ocean's top predators, capable of hunting great white sharks and even blue whale calves.<br><br>

<u>Lion:</u> A social apex predator in Africa. While a single lion has a success rate of about 17–19%, hunting in a pride increases this to 30%, allowing them to take down massive prey like buffalo and occasionally young elephants.<br><br>

<u>Tiger:</u> The largest of the big cats, with some Siberian tigers weighing up to 300 kg (660 lbs). They are typically solitary, nocturnal hunters.<br><br>

<u>Gray Wolf:</u> The largest wild canid, often weighing up to 80 kg (176 lbs). Their success comes from highly coordinated pack hunting. </h4></b><br>
<u><h1>Giant Predators of the Past - </h1></u>
<h2>* Prehistoric eras featured mammalian predators significantly larger than those alive today:</h2>
<b><h4><u>Andrewsarchus:</u> An Eocene mammal (related to hippos and whales) that may have been the largest terrestrial mammalian predator ever, estimated at 1,000 kg (2,200 lbs).<br><br>
<u>Arctotherium (Giant Short-Faced Bear):</u> A South American bear that could weigh up to 1,600 kg (3,500 lbs) and stand over 3 meters (11 ft) tall on its hind legs.<br><br>
<u>Saber-Toothed Cats:</u> Species like Smilodon populator reached weights of over 400 kg (880 lbs)</h4></b><br>
<u><h1>Hunting Strategies and Efficiency - </h1></u>
<h2>* Predators use diverse tactics to secure a meal, and their success rates vary wildly: 
</h2>
<b><h4><u>Ambush Hunting:</u> Used by cats like leopards and tigers who rely on stealth.<br><br>
<u>Persistence/Endurance Hunting:</u> African wild dogs have one of the highest kill rates (over 85%) by chasing prey until it collapses from exhaustion.<br><br>
<u>Cooperative Hunting:</u> Lions and wolves use social structures to overwhelm prey much larger than themselves.</h4></br>
