   <u><h1>Key Characteristics of Reptiles - </h1></u> 
   <b><h4><u>Skin & Respiration:</u> Reptiles have tough, dry, scaly skin, which allows them to live in dry habitats and away from water sources.<br><br>
<u>Temperature Regulation:</u> They are ecotherms (cold-blooded), meaning they rely on environmental heat to regulate their body temperature, often basking to stay warm.<br><br>
<u>Reproduction:</u> Almost all reptiles lay eggs on land (oviparous), although a few species, such as some snakes, give birth to live young (viviparous).<br><br>
<u>Habitat:</u> While many are terrestrial, some are highly adapted for aquatic or marine environments.<br><br>
<u>Diet:</u> Most are carnivorous or insectivorous, although some are herbivorous. </h4></b><br>
<u><h1>Major Groups (Orders) - </h1></u>
<b><h4><u>Squamata:</u> Snakes, lizards, and worm lizards.<br><br>
<u>Testudines:</u> Turtles and tortoises.<br><br>
<u>Crocodylia:</u> Crocodiles, alligators, caimans, and gharials.<br><br>
<u>Rhynchocephalia:</u> The tuatara.<br><br> 
</h4></b><br>
<u><h1>Other Facts & "Others" - </h1></u>
<b><h4><u>Evolution:</u> Reptiles dominated the Earth for 186 million years during the Mesozoic era.<br><br>
<u>Herpetology:</u> The study of reptiles is combined with the study of amphibians, known as herpetology.<br><br>
<u>Dietary Habits:</u> Many reptiles, particularly crocodiles, swallow their food whole.<br><br>
<u>Conservation:</u> Many species are threatened by habitat loss, pollution, and overexploitation.<br><br>
<u>Health Warning:</u> Pet reptiles and amphibians can carry Salmonella bacteria, making proper handling and hygiene essential. </h4></b><br>
