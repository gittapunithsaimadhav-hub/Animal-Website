    <u><h1>Key Aspects of Aquatic and Marine Wildlife - </h1></u>
    <b><h4><u>Habitats:</u> Aquatic habitats include freshwater (rivers, lakes) and marine (oceans, estuaries). Marine zones are divided by light availability (photic vs. aphotic) and depth (benthic, neritic).<br><br>
<u>Biodiversity:</u> Over 242,000 documented marine species exist, with roughly two million yet to be discovered.<br><br>
<u>Marine Mammals:</u> Include cetaceans (whales, dolphins), pinnipeds (seals, walruses), and sea otters, which are warm-blooded and often rely on blubber for insulation.<br><br>
<u>Invertebrates:</u> Diverse groups including mollusks (squid, octopus) and cnidarians (jellyfish, corals) that often form complex, essential ecosystems.<br><br>
<u>Adaptations:</u> Marine life has evolved unique features for pressure, darkness, and salinity, such as streamlining for speed, gills for breathing, and, in many fish, ectothermic (cold-blooded) metabolism.<br><br>
<u>Threats and Conservation:</u> Marine ecosystems face severe threats, including overfishing (depleting over 70% of fish stocks), pollution, and climate change. Less than 1% of marine systems have protection, making conservation crucial for protecting the species and the over 1 billion people relying on them for protein. </h4></b><br>
<p><h2>"Marine animals are often categorized by their position in the water column: plankton (drifters), nekton (swimmers), and benthos (bottom dwellers). "</h2></p>
