    <u><h1>Key Characteristics of Primates - </h1></u>
   <b><h4><u>Adaptations:</u> Features include forward-facing eyes for binocular vision, large brains, and nails instead of claws, aiding in grasping branches.<br><br>
<u>Locomotion:</u> Many are arboreal, moving via leaping, swinging (brachiation), or quadrupedalism in the canopy.<br><br>
<u>Diet:</u> Generally omnivorous, relying heavily on fruit, leaves, and insects.<br><br>
<u>Social Structure:</u> They live in varied groups, from solitary individuals to complex social troops. </h4></b><br>
<u><h1>Forest Environments and Inhabitants - </h1></u>
<h2>* Primates dominate tropical forest canopies, but are one part of a complex ecosystem. Other forest animals include: </h2>
<b><h4><u>Arboreal Specialists:</u> Sloths (3-toed), tree-shrews, and various monkeys.<br><br>
<u>Ground Dwellers:</u> Large apes like gorillas and various terrestrial monkeys.<br><br>
<u>Camouflaged Species:</u> The okapi (related to the giraffe) lives in dense African forests. </h4></b><br>
<u><h1>Primate Divisions - </h1></u>
<b><h4><u>Prosimians:</u> Lemurs, lorises, and galagos.<br><br>
<u>New World Monkeys:</u> Found in Central/South America, many have prehensile tails.<br><br>
<u>Old World Monkeys & Apes:</u> Found in Africa and Asia. </h4></b><br>
<u><h1>Ecological Importance - </h1></u>
<b><h4>Primates are vital for biodiversity. By eating fruit and traveling, they disperse seeds, which helps maintain forest structure and growth. </h4></b>
