    <u><h1>Key Aspects of Birds and Small Creatures - </h1></u>
    <b><h4><u>Unique Bird Traits:</u> Birds are the only animals with feathers and are technically specialized theropod dinosaurs. They have 4-chambered hearts, high metabolic rates, and can have heart rates up to 1000 beats per minute while flying.<br><br>
<u>Flight and Anatomy:</u> While wings are standard, some, such as penguins, have adapted them for swimming. The Kiwi is the only bird without wings.<br><br>
<u>Diverse Habitats:</u> Birds are found globally, from Arctic regions to hot deserts.<br><br>
<u>Reproduction:</u> Most birds lay eggs in nests, ranging from simple scrapes to complex structures.<br><br>
<u>Small Creatures Ecosystem:</u> Many birds are crucial for controlling small creatures (insects, small rodents). Conversely, small creatures can be beneficial, such as ants used by birds to control parasites (anting).
